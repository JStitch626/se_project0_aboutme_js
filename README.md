# Project 0: About Me

In order to enroll in Practicum's software engineering bootcamp, we were required to create this About Me webpage. Practicum provided the starter code. Through a series of short lessons and exercises, we began to build our first webpage. Once the page was completed, we shared it with others in our cohort within the se-community on Discord.

Thus began my journey toward becoming a software engineer!
